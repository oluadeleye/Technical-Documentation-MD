          <p>The term “Mediterranean Diet” was introduced in the 1950’s by the studies of nutritionist Ancel Keys (at that time he lived in Salerno, near Naples, Italy) and colleagues, and refers to dietary habits characterized by the consumption of large quantities of vegetables, legumes, fruits, cereals, with extravirgin olive oil as the main source of fat, and low intake of meat, especially red meat. These dietary habits were formulated through the century, are an healthy protecting diet with also pleasant taste that contribute to a better quality of life.</p>
          <p>The concept of Mediterranean diet as a healthy diet was first publicized in 1945 by Ancel Keys, an American scientist, when he was stationed in Salerno, Italy. He was impressed by the healthy state of the population, which was attributed to the diet, rich in olive oil, fruit and vegetables, breads and cereals. Early observations on the beneficial effect of Mediterranean diet in 1960s were related to low incidence of coronary artery disease and myocardial infraction in the island of Crete
and regions of Southern Italy. Another supportive factor on
the healthy model of Cretan diet was the data of longevity,
which was the longest in the island of Crete.</p>

           <p>The interest generated by the effects of the Mediterranean diet on coronary heart disease was expanded to investigate its role in the prevention or lowering the risk of other diseases, namely certain cancers, metabolic syndrome (obesity, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hypertension), mental disease (depression) and neurological disease (Parkinson and Alzheimer). Studies and metaanalysis data showed that adherence to Mediterranean diet is an important contributor to health status, mortality, survival and longevity (22).</p>

          <p>Mediterranean diet is basically a plant-based dietary pattern, characterized by 1) olive oil, as the principal source of fat and low in animal fat and protein, 2) daily consumption of fresh fruit and vegetable, cereals, grain, pulses, beans, legumes, pasta, rice and nuts, 3) moderate consumption of dairy products, and fish, 4) low consumption of sweets and salty foods, 5) very low consumption of red and processed meat. Moderate amount of wine, preferably red wine rich in polyphenols and flavonoids supplements meals.</p>

          <p>The principal aspects of Mediterranean diet are presented schematically in the pyramid model (Figure 1), a graphic representation, initiated by Willett and co-workers (23), based on dietary patterns in Crete and Southern Italy in the early 1960s. The base and lower part of the pyramid represent foods, which should be included daily, namely breads, pasta, rice, cereals, fruits, vegetables, olive oil, as the principal source of fat, pulses, legumes, olives, nuts. Dairy products, fish,
poultry, eggs and sweets are recommended few times per
week. At the top of the pyramid red and processed meat,
consumed 1-2 times per month, not exceeding 100 g/meal.
It is worthy to note that red meat includes not only beef, but also pork and lamb, whereas white meat, which is preferable, includes fish, chicken and turkey. An important factor for the benefits of Mediterranean diet is daily physical exercise which augments the health effects. </p>

          <p>Olive oil with high concentration of unsaturated fatty acids,mainly oleic acid, is the principal characteristic of Mediterranean diet. Oleic acid is linked with the reduction of risk of coronary heart disease (Keys et al., 1986). Oleic acid has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-hypertensive effects, improves cholesterol regulation and reduces LDL cholesterol.
In addition, oleic acid has a beneficial effect on composition of secondary bile acids which exert a deleterious effect with polyamine metabolism on colonic epithelial cells. There is also evidence that it inhibits progression of adenoma to cancer, which may explain the protective effect of Mediterranean diet to colonic cancer.</p>

          <p> Pharmacist can recommend diet alternatives to patients who are at risk of cardiovascular disease. This can be done during medication therapy management. Educating them on alternatives to help with their health would be challenging especially when the patient has been on a medication regimen for so long. Also the patinets might also find it difficult to incorporate diet modifications especially when they are not adhering to their medication regimen. But i feel that if the pharmacist can be successful in convincing the patients to change their diet, with the past studies done on the effects of Mediterranean diet, the patients would see a significant improvement in their health.</p>
